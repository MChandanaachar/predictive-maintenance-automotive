# Predictive Maintenance System for Automotive Components

## Overview
This project predicts maintenance requirements for automotive components using sensor data and machine learning. The system helps identify early signs of failure to reduce downtime and improve safety.

## Features
- Sensor-based input (temperature, RPM, torque, usage hours)
- Machine learning model for failure prediction
- Maintenance recommendation (Safe / Warning / Critical)
- User-friendly dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning (Random Forest)
- Web UI (Lovable-generated)

## How It Works
1. User inputs sensor data
2. Data is preprocessed
3. ML model predicts component condition
4. System recommends maintenance action

## Future Improvements
- Real-time sensor integration
- Time-series analysis
- Vehicle-specific models
